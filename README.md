# Learn Maya Scripting
This repo was created for the purpose of documenting my process learning Maya Python scripting in Python and Mel. 
all the notes and tricks will be intertwined with the code itself as comments. 

----

ðŸ”—Maya API, python and C++

Learn and use Mayaâ€™s API(cmds, PyMel, MEL, Python 2.7, and C++ ) to create procedural maya plug-ins as procedural tools to create animations procedurally and easily.

  * **Questions and Tasks:**

   1. Why using Maya? Why write scripts or a plug-ins for Maya? (from Maya and CGI industryâ€™s histories, pipelines, Software designâ€™s perspectives)
   2. Compare different approaches, draw conclusions.
   3. Understand the mechanisms behind the curtain of Maya.
   4. Build demo scripts, make tools and document.
   5. Make more complex tools such as the tools I used to make in Houdini.
   6. Draw conclusions:
       1. Design of tool?
       2. Is it user-friendly?
       3. Any bugs?
       4. Howâ€™s performance?
       5. How to improve it?
       6. The future?
